# cs61a

This repo contains my Jupyter notebooks and other python code whilst I follow Berkeleys CS61a course.

My notebooks tend to have bits of homework assignments and other random code from watching the lectures,
so I don't expect it to be of much use to anybody but myself.

## Rationale

A number of colleagues asked me how to learn to program, and as part of my research, I found this course that is based on the famous text Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programs. In order to decide whether it would be a good fit, I've been following the lectures and doing the homework - I also get to learn Python whilst I'm at it. The course originally used Scheme, but has been recently revised to be based around Python.

The instance of this course as taught by John Denero is excellent, and I'd highly recommend it to anybody who wants a serious grounding in programming fundementals.

## Jupyter

I've been using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to run code during lectures and homework assignments. I've also found it useful to install [Jupyter Vim Bindings](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding), since the more Vim the better.
