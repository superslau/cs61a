# cs61a

This repo contains my Jupyter notebooks and other python code whilst I follow Berkeleys CS61a course.

Lecture videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/papajohnno/playlists
Course Page: https://cs61a.org/

My notebooks tend to have bits of homework assignments and other random code from watching the lectures,
so I don't expect it to be of much use to anybody but myself.

## Academic Honor Code

Berkeley CS61a students should refer to the following link, not that you'd want to copy my code :)
